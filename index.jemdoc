== About me
I am a second-year M.Phil student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised 
by Prof. [https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/ Anthony Man-Cho So]. I also work with Prof. [https://www.vietanhnguyen.net/ Viet Anh Nguyen].
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics (2019-2023) 
from Tongji University where I worked with Prof. [https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/12378.html/ Zhaolin Hu]. I will be joining 
[https://www.mit.edu/ Massachusetts Institute of Technology] this fall.

I mainly study *optimization* theory and its applications in economics and machine learning. Recently, I am also interested in language model (i.e. alignment, uncertainty qualification).
