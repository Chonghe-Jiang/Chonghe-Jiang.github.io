== About me
I am a second-year M.Phil student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong fortunately advised 
by Prof. [https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/ Anthony Man-Cho So]. Previously, 
I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics (2019-2023; Elite Class) 
from Tongji University supervised by Prof. [https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/12378.html/ Zhaolin Hu].


== Research
=== Research Interests
 I study continuous optimization theory and its applications in data science, computational economics, decision-making under uncertainty and language model.
